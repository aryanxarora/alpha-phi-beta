                    <li>In the height of the presidency of Manuel Quezon, some students of the UP College of Law were motivated to dampen a threatened dictatorship about to be born with the creation of a “one-party” government in October 1939. With these, they aspire to be at the forefront of mobilizing the student body into being a relevant factor not only in the campus but also in the national arena. These inspired them to form an organization that would be held together by fraternal bonds.

                    <li>A long line of six Alphan editors would follow in Rey's wake, some serving consecutively. His immediate successor would be Leo Quisumbing, followed over the next seven years, by Wilfredo Chato, Salvador Carlota, Voltaire Garcia, Temario Rivera and Nelson Navarro.</li>

His leadership was true to the spirit of the press, unflinching at the threats of the Marcos administration. Ten days before his fateful arrest, his Collegian was able to release the special collective editorial entitled “Uphold Campus Freedom”, underscored by the remarkable banner headline:</li>
